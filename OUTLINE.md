# GIT for wizards:






















## Problem:
- bad slides, no real learning, wrong-answered question banks

























## Presentation VS workshop:
- Live-action coding
- The lecture is already small why not
- every section will have a problem and they will solve it with us.
- use your tools (2 laptops 2 screens) board if needed, remote 
- it needs to be cohesive as if 1 body is explaining everything 
    - same examples on the repo changing the same files.























## Main resource:
- The primeagen frontend masters: GIT WORKSHOP
- [Everything You'll Need to Know About Git](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/git/) 
- [written content](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-git/)

## _CTA_:
<!-- - watch the course to know everything that may encounter you. -->
- Research Your part to the fullest

    - after content is written we will:
        1. make the slides
        2. start the QB Write away
        3. Make the first rehearsal
