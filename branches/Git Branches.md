# Outline

- [I]  [[Branches]], [[merge]] and moreÂ `Amir`
    - [*] creating your second branch ðŸ˜‰ (branch - checkout - switch)
    - [*] deleting a branch
    - [*] merge baby merge (git merge)
    - [*] types of merge (FF - m)
    - [*] [[rebase]] your history (git rebase)
    - [*] rebase vs merge internal war


## Movement Draft

1. *slides*: what is a branch why you should always branch
2. *code*: create a branch
	1. create repo
	2. commit "A" into README.md
	3. create branch foo
3. *search*: search for the branch in the .git folder
	1. why branches are nearly free
4. *code*: switch to the new branch
	1. commit "B" and "C"
5. *question*: what you do after you finish your best work? *you merge*
6. *slides*: 2 ways to handle this situation **merge** and **rebase*
	1. we will see first merge which has 2 possible outcomes
7. *code*: **MAKE A DIVERGENCE MERGE**
	1. switch to main
	2. commit "D" and "E" into main.md
	3. make a new branch here named main-merge-foo `(effectively main)`
	4. merge
	5. git log --graph --parents --oneline
	6. see the merge
8. *slides*: divergence merge, best common ancestor, merge commits
9. *code*: **MAKE A FAST_FORWARD MERGE**`
	1. switch to main
	2. make and checkout branch bar
	3. commit "X", "Y" into bar.md
	4. switch to main
	5. and merge bar
10. *slides*: **REBASE**
	1. what is rebase
	2. why some people hate it (altering history)
	3. show current setup
	4. what rebase will do *and what that enables us to do* - more in that in last point 
		1. Explain the actual steps
11. *code*: make a rebase at `foo-rebase-main`
	1. checkout foo
	2. create and checkout foo-rebase-main
	3. rebase main
12. *slides*: pros and cods
	1. pros:
		- [p] clean history
		- [p] better in searching
	2. cons:
		- [c] have to use *`force`* when pushing to remote because it alters branch history
13. **slides**: **Always merge on public branches, rebase | merge on private branches**

## **COMMANDS**

```bash
# step 1 - create repo initial commit
mkdir git-branches
cd git-branches
git init
echo "A" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "A"
git log --graph --oneline

# step 2 - new branch
git branch foo
git checkout foo
find .git

# step 3 - 2 commit in foo
echo "B" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "B"
echo "C" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "C"
git log --graph --oneline

# step 4 - 2 commits in main
git checkout main
echo "D" >> second.md
git add .
git commit -m "D"
echo "E" >> second.md
git add .
git commit -m "E"
git log --graph --oneline

# step 5 - divergence merge
git checkout main
git checkout -b main-merge-foo
git merge foo
git log --graph --oneline --parents

# step 6 - prepare bar for fastforward merge
git checkout main
git checkout -b bar
echo "X" >> bar.md
git add .
git commit -m "X"
echo "Y" >> bar.md
git add .
git commit -m "Y"
git log --graph --oneline --parents

# step 7 - fastforward merge
git checkout main
git merge bar
git log --graph --oneline --parents

# step 8 - rebase
git checkout foo
git rebase main
git log --graph --oneline
```

## Slides content:
1. what is a branch:
	> Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.
	- [i]  branches are virtually free in git just a [[SHA]] to a commit/tree
2. what is a merge?
>	A merge is attempting to combine two histories together that have diverged at some point in the past. There is a common commit point between the two, this is referred to as the best common ancestor
- [P]  merging have 2 different outcomes depending on the state of the history
	- [D] **Fast Forward**: just update the pointer/reference (no merge commits)
	- [D] **Divergence merge**: create a merge commit to combine 2 commits/histories have 2 parents
3. what is rebasing?
	> git-rebase - Reapply commits on top of another base tip - "the docs"
4. How rebase works? executing *`git rebase <targetbranch>`* - `targetbranch` is often main
	1. checkout the latest commit at *`<targetbranch>`*
	2. play one commit at a time of the current branch - `current branch is often the feature branch`
	3. update current branch to the latest `SHA`
		- [!] **be careful rebase alters history so don't ever rebase main/ public branches**
5. merge vs rebase:
	- [I] **Merge**:
		- [u] doesn't alter history
		- [u] doesn't require `push force`
		- [u] works with private and public branches without problems
		- [d] makes annoying merge commits 
	- [I] **Rebase**:
		- [d] alters history
		- [d] requires `push force`
		- [i] works with private branches only
		- [u] no annoying merge commits
		- [u] linear history which is easier to search
6. **workflows war**:
	1. Merge flow (just merge)
		1. merge back into main
		2. commit msgs happens
	2. Rebase flow (rebase in private - FF merge in public)
		1. rebase main into your branch first
		2. then fast-forward merge into main
