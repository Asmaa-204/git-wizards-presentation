# GIT for wizards:






















## Problem:
- bad slides, no real learning, wrong-answered question banks

























## Presentation VS workshop:
- Live-action coding
- The lecture is already small why not
- every section will have a problem and they will solve it with us.
- use your tools (2 laptops 2 screens) board if needed, remote 
- it needs to be cohesive as if 1 body is explaining everything 
    - same examples on the repo changing the same files.























## Main resource:
- The primeagen frontend masters: GIT WORKSHOP
- [Everything You'll Need to Know About Git](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/git/) 
- [written content](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-git/)
























### SAMPLE OUTLINE (will change):
- `TIME: 1h30m` =>> every 1 has 10m + 20m for quiz and wasted time


1. INTRO:
    - MOTIVATION
    - What is git
    - Terminology (repo - commit - working tree - untracked - staged - tracked)
    - how will we move on from now on?
2. Hi Git:
    - git config basics
    - creating a new repo
    - first commit (BATMAN) (add  - commit -m)
    - git status
    - git log with options (--graph --online) âœ¨
3. git magic demystified:
    - what is a SHA(secure hashing algo) just a pointer at the end
    - what is inside the magical .git folder
    - git objects (blobs, trees, commits)
    - git cat-file -p
4. Branches merge and more
    - creating your second branch ðŸ˜‰ (branch - checkout - switch)
    - deleting a branch
    - merge baby merge (git merge)
    - types of merge (FF - m)
    - rebase your history (git rebase)
    - rebase vs merge internal war
5. Where is my HEAD? ðŸ§Ÿ
    - HEAD and refs
    - git reflog
    - delete a branch and restore it with git reflog
    - git cherry-pick (what if you want to add a single commit to your branch)
6. Going remote
    - what is a remote
    - git fetch
    - git pull
    - git push
    - oppsi I think there is a conflict
7. Bullets of fancy git commands:
    - interactive (reword - squash - reorder) commits
    - stash
    - revert vs reset - where is the fun
    - tags and releases
8. tools, more to look for, refs
    - lazygit
    - (git worktrees, git workflows, git actions)
    - thank you
